# Weather-vs-Event-Checkerker

The point of this project is to collaborate in a group and use everything that this bootcamp has taught us into practical use. As this is our first group project, we will be trending into unknown territory.

The project that we have decided on is a weather application that allows users to input a city of their choice and know what the weather will be like. As well as know any local activities that are being planned for the day. We will have two separate pages, the user will se the home page where they will be able to input a city.

Then once submitted, they will be taken to a second page with a BULMA css format listing and decribing the events that are taking place. Users will see the weather for the upcoming week.

There will be a back button to let users navigate back to the homepage if they want to put in a different city. Then they will see three subsections, the first will print out what will be occurring. The second section will indicate if any of the outdoor events will be avilable for the following week Then the last section will tell the user what indoor events will be available if the weather isn't the most favorable.

This project aims to solve the problem of trying to plan a fun day but sometimes the weather gets in the way of that. Even if it ends up being too cold outside or too hot, why should that stop you from heading out? Our application will inform users that there is still plenty of fun to be had with your day with the other potential events in your local area.
